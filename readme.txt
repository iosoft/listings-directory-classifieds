= Plugin conception =
Levels of listings control the functionality amount of listings and their directory/classifieds conception.
Each listing may belong to different levels, some may have eternal active period, have sticky status and enabled
google maps, other may have greater number of allowed attached images or videos. It is perfect base for business model of your directory site.

Each content field field belongs to the type that defines its behaviour and display. You may hide field name, select custom field icon,
set field as required, manage visibility on pages. Also listings may be ordered by some fields.
Note that you may assign fields for specific categories. This is important feature allows to build category-specific content fields.
For instance: there may be special *'price'* field especially in *'Classifieds/For sale'* category and all its subcategories, so this field will appear
only in listings, those were assigned with this category.
